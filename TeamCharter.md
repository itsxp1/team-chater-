1. **What are your team’s goals for the collaboration?**

	List your goals here. These should be high-level goals, and can be directly related to the project (what you hope to build), the process (how you hope to build it), the tools (what you hope to use to build it), or personal goals (what you hope to get out of the project).

2. **Who is responsible for each activity? What roles will each member have?**

	Describe team responsibilities and roles. An agile team is self-organizing, and you should be flexible, but it may make sense for certain team members to "own" certain parts of the project. Update this as needed.

3. **What is your timetable for activities?**  

	This is a high-level timetable. Think about this in terms of mid-month and end-of-month for the remainder of the term. You will set more detailed goals later, using GitLab's project support, and track progress there.

4. **What are your team’s expectations regarding meeting attendance (being on time, leaving early, missing meetings, etc.)?**

   List your attendance policy for meetings outside of class here. You will want to have at least one in-person meeting per week if possible. 

5. **What constitutes an acceptable excuse for missing a meeting or a deadline?  What types of excuses will not be considered acceptable?**

   List your policy here. There should be an expectation that everyone attends meetings, which is why it's important to have a process for when someone needs to be absent. For deadlines, again, the assumption should be that deadlines are met, but you will want a process for _proactively_ managing when they are not.

6. **What process will team members follow if they have an emergency and cannot attend a team meeting or complete their individual work promised to the team (deliverable)?**

   List your policy here. I would be specific about the amount of notice needed.

7. **What are your team’s expectations regarding the quality of team members’ preparation for team meetings and the quality of the deliverables that members bring to the team?**

   List your expectations here.

8. **What are your team’s expectations regarding team members’ ideas, interactions with the team, cooperation, attitudes, and anything else regarding team-member contributions?**

   List your expectations here. Your goal should be to allow everyone to contribute, but you also need to ensure you can come to consensus or (if not possible) make a decision when needed. 

9. **What methods will be used to keep the team on track?**

   We will use GitLab features for task tracking, so focus on methods outside of this here.
